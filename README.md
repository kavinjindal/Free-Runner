# Free-Runner
This is my first evert game that I have started working on. It is a running game like Super Mario.  I was recently learning Gdevelop and I have started making my own games using this software. This is likely to release by the end of October so stay tuned. 

# Platforms:
I am thinking of releasing this game on all platforms, but for a start this game will release only for platforms below
* Windows
* MacOs
* Linux

# Version
* The first version which will release will be 1.1.0

# Features

 - The game will have a character which will run through the map created.
 - He will collect coins on the way.
 - There are currently no enemies added, but there will be enemies inserted in the future updates of the game.
 - There are 4 lives for the player in the whole game.
 
# Installation:
- > There is another node.zip file that you will have to install in your system in order to run the game. 
- > The file is known as node.dll, this file is essential to run several games on systems.
